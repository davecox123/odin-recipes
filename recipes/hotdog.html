    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>On the streets of Seattle, after the bars close, and 
       during sporting events, these are a local favorite--warm
       cream cheese spread on your favorite hotdog!</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>

        <li>4 hot dogs, or your favorite sausages</li>
        <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
        <li>brown mustard</li>
        <li>1 cup sauerkraut</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

            medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Add onions, and cook slowly until the onions have
