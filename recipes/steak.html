    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A great flank steak marinade like this quick and easy
         one is important if you want a tender, juicy,
          flavorful steak. Make sure you marinate your flank
           steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer
         if you have time. I invented this wonderful marinated, 
         grilled flank steak recipe and my friends and girls 
         just love it. This recipe also works great when the 
         steak is sliced and used for fajitas.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>     
   
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>

    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice,
            Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and 
            pepper for marinade until thoroughly combined. 
            Place steak in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over flank steak in the baking dish;
            turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade.
            Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to
            12 hours if you have time.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for
            medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off 
            excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5
            minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes
             before slicing and serving.</li>
